# DeviceType SwiftStarterApp/Utilities/DeviceUtilities.swift
## Imported Code Object
In the provided code snippet, `DeviceType` is an enumeration (or `enum`) in Swift. An enumeration is a user-defined data type that defines a set of related values, called enumeration cases.

In this particular case, `DeviceType` is an enumeration that has three cases: `.ipad`, `.iphone`, and `.mac`. These cases represent different types of devices.

The `: String` part after `DeviceType` indicates that the raw value type of the enumeration is `String`. This means that each enumeration case is implicitly assigned a string value, which is the case name itself (e.g., `.ipad` has a raw value of `"ipad"`, `.iphone` has a raw value of `"iphone"`, and so on).

Enumerations in Swift are typically used to represent a fixed set of related values, rather than using arbitrary strings or integers. They provide type safety and can be used in switch statements, which helps to ensure that all possible cases are handled.

In the context of the given code, `DeviceType` could be used to represent different types of devices in an application, and the corresponding logic can be implemented based on the device type. For example, you might have different user interface layouts or functionality depending on whether the app is running on an iPad, iPhone, or Mac.

# DeviceUtilities SwiftStarterApp/Utilities/DeviceUtilities.swift
## Imported Code Object
In the provided code snippet, `DeviceUtilities` is a Swift class that contains a utility function `deviceType()`. This function is designed to determine the type of device on which the app is running, and it returns an enumeration value of type `DeviceType`.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `class DeviceUtilities` defines a class named `DeviceUtilities`.
2. `public static func deviceType() -> DeviceType` declares a public static function named `deviceType` that returns a value of type `DeviceType`.
3. `#if os(iOS)` is a compilation condition that checks if the code is being compiled for iOS. If true, the code inside the condition block will be compiled.
4. `if UIDevice.isIPad` checks if the current device is an iPad. If true, it returns `DeviceType.ipad`.
5. `else if UIDevice.isIPhone` checks if the current device is an iPhone. If true, it returns `DeviceType.iphone`.
6. `#endif` ends the compilation condition block.
7. If the code is not compiled for iOS (i.e., it's being compiled for macOS), it returns `DeviceType.mac`.

The `DeviceType` is an enumeration (enum) that likely defines different cases for various device types, such as `.ipad`, `.iphone`, and `.mac`.

This utility function can be useful when you need to perform different actions or apply different UI/UX based on the device type. For example, you might want to display a different layout or provide different functionality for iPads compared to iPhones or Macs.

To use this function, you would call `DeviceUtilities.deviceType()` from within your code, and the returned `DeviceType` value can be used to make decisions or take appropriate actions based on the device type.
