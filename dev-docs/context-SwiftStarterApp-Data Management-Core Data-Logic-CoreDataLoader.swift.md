## Imported Code Object
In the provided code snippet, `CoreDataLoader` is a class responsible for loading and populating data into the Core Data store. It serves as a utility class to initialize the application's data when the Core Data store is empty.

Here's a breakdown of the class:

1. `LoadData()` is a static function that checks if there are any existing records in the Core Data store for the "Leaderboard" entity. If the store is empty, it calls two helper functions: `BuildUsers()` and `BuildLeaderboard()`.

2. `BuildUsers()` is a private static function that creates and persists five sample "Users" entities in the Core Data store. Each user has a unique UUID, username, and password.

3. `BuildLeaderboard()` is another private static function that creates and persists sample "Leaderboard" entities in the Core Data store. It iterates through the existing "Users" entities, generates a random score for each user, and creates a corresponding "Leaderboard" entity with the user's UUID and the random score.

4. The `CoreDataManager` and `PersistenceController` classes are likely utility classes used for managing the Core Data context and saving changes to the persistent store, respectively.

In summary, `CoreDataLoader` is a helper class that ensures the Core Data store is populated with some initial data when the app starts for the first time or when the store is empty. It creates sample user records and corresponding leaderboard entries with random scores. This class can be useful for testing purposes or providing a starting point for the app's data when there is no existing data in the Core Data store.
