## Imported Code Object
`CoreDataLoader` is a Swift class that contains static functions to load and populate data into the Core Data database. Here's what each part of the code does:

1. `LoadData()` function: This function checks if there are any existing records in the "Leaderboard" entity using `CoreDataManager_Leaderboard.shared.Count()`. If there are no records, it calls `BuildUsers()` and `BuildLeaderboard()` functions to populate the database with sample data.

2. `BuildUsers()` function: This function creates sample "Users" entities in the Core Data database. It creates five user objects with predefined usernames and passwords, assigns a new UUID to each user, and saves the changes to the database using `CoreDataManager.Commit()`.

3. `BuildLeaderboard()` function: This function creates sample "Leaderboard" entities in the Core Data database. It iterates over the existing "Users" entities using `CoreDataManager_Users.shared.items`. For each user, it creates a new "Leaderboard" entity with a random score between 0 and 99, associates it with the user's UUID, and saves the changes to the database using `CoreDataManager.Commit()`.

In summary, `CoreDataLoader` is a utility class that helps populate the Core Data database with sample data when there are no existing records. It creates a set of predefined users and associates random scores with each user in the "Leaderboard" entity. This class is likely used for testing or demonstration purposes, as it provides a consistent set of sample data for the application to work with.
