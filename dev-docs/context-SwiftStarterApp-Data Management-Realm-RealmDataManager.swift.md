# getKey SwiftStarterApp/Data Management/Realm/RealmDataManager.swift
## Imported Code Object
In the code snippet provided, `getKey()` is a static function that retrieves an encryption key from the iOS Keychain or generates a new one if it doesn't exist. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It defines a unique identifier (`keychainIdentifier`) for the Keychain entry, which should be unique to your application.
2. It first checks if a key with the specified identifier already exists in the Keychain by querying the Keychain with a set of parameters (`kSecClass`, `kSecAttrApplicationTag`, `kSecAttrKeySizeInBits`, `kSecReturnData`).
3. If a key is found, it retrieves the existing key data from the Keychain and returns it.
4. If no existing key is found, it generates a new random 512-bit encryption key using `SecRandomCopyBytes`.
5. It then stores the newly generated key in the Keychain with the specified identifier and key size (512 bits).
6. If storing the new key in the Keychain is successful, it returns the newly generated key data.
7. If any error occurs during key retrieval or generation, it throws a `MyError.runtimeError` with an appropriate error message.

The purpose of this function is to provide a secure way of storing and retrieving an encryption key for your application, leveraging the iOS Keychain for secure storage. By using this function, you can ensure that your application has access to a consistent and secure encryption key, either by retrieving an existing one or generating a new one if none exists.
